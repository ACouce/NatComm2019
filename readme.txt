These two files ("main_antimut.R" and "serial_culture_antimut.R") contain all the basic code used to simulate how antimutator alleles invade a mutator, asexual population. All the relevant paremeters, variables and processes are commented throughout the scripts. To run the model, execute the source file "main_antimut.R" in any R interpreter (e.g. R studio in Windows, Mac and Linux; bash console in Linux), such as:

> source('main_antimut.R')

The output is a figure with two panels. The first panel shows the invasion dynamics of a single antimutator allele though time for three different conditions. The second one shows the corresponding effective selection coeffients, as discussed in the text.
